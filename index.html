          <h3 id="headline">Rick Rescorla - 27 May 1939 to 11 September 2001</h3>
          <p>Mr Rescorla was born in Hayle in Cornwall but became a US citizen in the 1960s and was decorated for bravery as a platoon leader during the Vietnam War.</p>
          <p>He was employed as head of security by Morgan Stanley, who occupied 20 floors of the south tower at the World Trade Center.</p>
          <p>Mr Rescorla made staff at the bank regularly practise escape drills that later saved their lives.</p>
          <p>When the attack happened he led people down the staircases, singing Cornish songs as he went.</p>
          <p>He then returned inside and was last seen on the 10th floor looking for more people to evacuate.</p>
          <p>The 62-year-old was one of 2,605 people who died when the two towers collapsed. His body was never recovered.</p></section>
